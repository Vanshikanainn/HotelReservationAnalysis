Also, the system contains all the buyers, sellers, and agent information. In addition, the system allows adding up the builder’s account too.  this project contains an admin panel and a simple client-side. In an overview of this web application, the user can simply register in order to use the features. Here, clients can search for the property details using the state names. As a result, the system filters out all the available properties with detailed information. The user can view property details such as name, location, pricing, features, images, floor plans, and more.
